# META-HARNESS: Self-Bootstrapping Agent Infrastructure

## What This Is
A meta-harness that GENERATES complete, runnable, self-evolving harness engineering projects.
It does NOT do the work itself — it produces executable systems that do the work.
First principles driven. Evidence based. Never stops at one pass. Innovates beyond requirements.

## The Core Loop (NOT a Pipeline)
```
┌─→ INTERPRET: What does the user actually need? (first principles)
│       ↓
│   GENERATE: Create a COMPLETE harness project (7 layers + 2 cross-cutting + evolution)
│       ↓
│   PROVE:   Does every layer have concrete executable artifacts?
│       ↓
│   JUDGE:   Is the generated project sufficient? ──→ NO → root cause → loop back
│       ↓
│   YES
│       ↓
│   EVOLVE:  What did we learn about generation? Improve the meta-harness.
│       ↓
│   INNOVATE: What can go beyond the original requirements? Propose innovations.
│       ↓
└── LOOP:    Continuous improvement, never stop at "good enough"
```

## Architecture: 7 Layers + 2 Cross-Cutting + Self-Evolution + Innovation

Every generated harness project MUST have all of these layers with executable artifacts:

| Layer | Directory | Purpose | Key Artifacts |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Context Engineering | `context/` | Project context, knowledge index, dynamic loading | `loader.py`, `knowledge-index.yaml` |
| 2. Tool Integration | `tools/` | Tool schemas, sandbox, permissions, MCP | `schemas.yaml`, `sandbox.yaml`, `permissions.yaml` |
| 3. Memory & State | `memory/` | Session state, long-term memory, snapshots, compression | `snapshot.py`, `session-state.yaml`, `compression-rules.yaml` |
| 4. Planning & Orchestration | `planning/` | DAG builder, flow control, sub-agent dispatch, budgets | `dag-builder.py`, `flow-control.yaml`, `sub-agent-dispatch.yaml`, `budget.yaml` |
| 5. Verification & Guardrails | `verification/` | Format validators, consistency checks, security, self-check | `consistency-check.py`, `self-check.py`, `security-guardrails.yaml` |
| 6. Feedback & Self-Healing | `feedback/` | Error capture, retry, mistake→constraint, human interface | `error-capture.py`, `mistake-to-constraint.py`, `retry-config.yaml` |
| 7. Constraints & Entropy | `constraints/` | Architecture rules, linter config, entropy reduction, cost | `entropy-reduction.py`, `architecture-rules.yaml`, `cost-budget.yaml` |
| Cross-cutting A: Security | `security/` | Sandbox, encryption, audit | `sandbox-config.yaml`, `encryption-rules.yaml`, `audit-log.yaml` |
| Cross-cutting B: Observability | `observability/` | Tracing, metrics, replay, versioning | `tracing.yaml`, `metrics-dashboard.yaml`, `session-replay.yaml`, `versioning.yaml` |
| Self-Evolution | `evolution/` | Evidence-driven evolution with genome and fitness | `framework.md`, `genome.yaml`, `log.yaml` |
| Innovation | `evolution/` | Post-requirement innovation engine (推陈出新) | `innovation-engine.py`, `product-analyzer.py`, `domain-advancements.yaml` |

## Innovation Engine: 推陈出新

After all acceptance criteria are met, the system does NOT stop. The innovation engine activates:

1. **Product State Analyzer** (`product-analyzer.py`) scans `src/`, identifies implemented features, endpoints, models, tests
2. **Domain Advancement Patterns** (`domain-advancements*.yaml`) define four stages per domain:
   - **Basic** → **Solid** → **Advanced** → **Excellent**
3. **Innovation Engine** (`innovation-engine.py`) proposes innovations for the next stage
4. Proposals are prioritized by impact/effort ratio and saved to `innovation-log.yaml`
5. High-effort or security innovations require human approval

## Four-Stage Advancement Model

| Stage | Meaning | Web App Examples | API Service Examples |
|-------|---------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Basic | Meets requirements | Core features, basic tests | CRUD endpoints, validation |
| Solid | Production-ready | Error boundaries, loading states, pagination | Rate limiting, health checks, logging |
| Advanced | Competitive quality | Offline support, dark mode, search | Cursor pagination, webhooks, caching |
| Excellent | Market-leading | Real-time collaboration, a11y, i18n | GraphQL, event sourcing, circuit breakers |

## First Principles (Override Everything)
1. Do not assume the user knows what they want — ask if unclear
2. If goal is clear but path isn't optimal, say so and suggest better
3. Chase root causes, never patch symptoms — every decision answers "why"
4. Output only what changes decisions — cut everything else

## Meta-Rules (Cannot Be Overridden)
1. No execution without interpretation
2. No agent without a harness
3. No constraint without a reason
4. No completion without EVIDENCE — output must prove it satisfies the original need
5. No single-pass execution — the loop continues until evidence proves success
6. No patching symptoms — always chase root causes
7. Generate EXECUTABLE systems, not just documents — every layer must have concrete artifacts
8. Every generated layer must have concrete artifacts — no empty or doc-only layers
9. Every generation is logged
10. Every failure improves the meta (with root cause)
11. The meta-harness follows its own rules
12. Evolution never removes verification (cancer prevention)
13. Evolution never removes itself (suicide prevention)
14. All mutations are reversible
15. After requirements are met, innovation engine MUST run (推陈出新)
16. Innovation proposals require human approval for high-effort or security changes
